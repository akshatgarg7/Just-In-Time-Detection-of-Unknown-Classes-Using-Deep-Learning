# Just-In-Time-Detection-of-Unknown-Classes-Using-Deep-Learning
<p>To accurately differentiate objects or feature classes, various industries frequently use neural networks for their tasks. However, re-training the network on the changed dataset is often necessary when adding or deleting new instances. This causes additional costs and sometimes it is time-consuming. Additionally, a sufficient amount of new training data is required to achieve good performance. Open Set Classifier (OSC) has many applications in the area of self-driving cars, medical applications, an android with self-learning, etc. We will focus on accurately classifying OSC in real-time without re-training the real-time.

In  this stage we build a  Siamese Network and fitted it on Fruit 360 dataset to understand how it works and get to know its implementation. 



Before ruinning the code install requirements.txt by running followin command in terminal """ sadasd """,
and run siamese network in jupyter notebook
